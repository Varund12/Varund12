#Date - 07/11/2023

#Importing the library
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

#Line graphing x and y
x = []
y = []

#Opening lines in the text file
for line in open('C:/Users/conra/Desktop/plotdata.txt', 'r'):
    #Splitting the lines in two for x and y.
    lines = [i for i in line.split()]
   
   # Appendinfg means adding constantly till the data and using float as txt files has number in decimals.
    x.append(float(lines[0]))
    y.append(float(lines[1]))

#Plotting the graph
    plt.plot(x, y, color='green', linestyle='dashed', linewidth = 3,
         marker='o', markerfacecolor='blue', markersize=12)
   
    #Labels
    plt.xlabel('X')
    plt.ylabel('Y')
    plt.title('Line Graph')

    #Display the graph
    plt.show()
